# Clay Under Load – A Simple Visual Guide to Undrained, Consolidation and Safety Stages

This page is a visual explanation of what happens when a clay layer is loaded — and how these effects are captured in a PLAXIS numerical model through three common analysis stages:

- **Undrained Plastic**
- **Consolidation**
- **Safety**

## 🟠 Undrained Plastic Stage

A load is applied quickly on a soft clay layer. There's no time for drainage.

- Excess **pore pressures increase rapidly**
- **Displacements** occur, mostly from shearing
- **Effective stress drops**

## 🔵 Consolidation Stage

As time progresses, pore water drains and:

- Pore pressure **dissipates**
- Effective stress **increases**
- Volume change occurs, causing **further settlement**

## 🟢 Safety Stage

Once drained, the safety stage checks long-term stability.

- All excess pore pressures are gone
- We observe the **deformation mechanism**
- Factor of Safety is calculated

**Failure Mechanism (Safety Stage):**
