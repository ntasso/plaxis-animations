# Clay Under Load â€“ A Visual Introduction to Undrained, Consolidation, and Safety Stages

This page presents a simplified numerical model built in [**PLAXIS**](https://www.plaxis.com/) to illustrate how saturated soft clay responds to surface loading through three typical **phases** of geotechnical analysis: **undrained plastic**, **consolidation**, and **safety**.

These phases were simulated using the [PLAXIS Finite Element software](https://www.plaxis.com/), widely used in geotechnical engineering.

      This 2D plain strain model represents a <strong>6-meter thick saturated clay layer</strong> loaded at the surface in three steps. The clay is <strong>normally consolidated</strong>, with <code>NSPT â‰ˆ 1</code>, representing a very soft deposit like those found in the Amazon region.

## ðŸŸ  Undrained Plastic Stage

The first load increment is applied quickly, and the soil does not have time to drain. This causes:

- An **instant increase in pore pressure**
- **Plastic displacements** under the load
- **Effective stress drop**
- Changes in **stress orientation** and **shear zones**

</p>

**Mohr Circles â€“ Point A and B:**

- At **Point A** (beneath the load), pore pressure increases while total stress moves rightward, keeping effective stress nearly constant.
- At **Point B** (next to the load), stress directions rotate and both total and effective stress states evolve.

## ðŸ”µ Consolidation Stage

After the undrained stage, the system is allowed to drain for a fixed period. During this time:

- **Pore pressures dissipate** gradually
- **Effective stresses increase**
- **Settlement continues** as volume change occurs
- The system transitions to a drained state

  </video>
</p>

**Mohr Circles During Consolidation:**

- Effective stress grows as water drains.
- At the end of this stage, total and effective stresses converge (pore pressure = 0).

## ðŸŸ¢ Safety Stage

After full consolidation, the model is tested for stability using the **strength reduction method** (SSR). In this stage:

- No excess pore pressure remains
- The **failure mechanism** becomes visible
- The **Factor of Safety (FoS)** is estimated by progressively reducing the strength parameters until collapse

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This simplified example demonstrates how numerical models can be used not only to simulate real scenarios, but also to **gain intuition** about soil behavior under staged loading.

Numerical tools like PLAXIS, combined with scripting through Python, enable fast exploration of multiple scenarios and help us make better geotechnical decisions.
